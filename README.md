# Fifty State Quarters Collector

This project is a single page application that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to view this project:
From your terminal:
### `git clone [this repository]`
Change the current working directory to your local repository.
### `cd [this repository]`
Move into the api sub-directory
### `cd api/`

Rename starterdata.json, specifying the old file name and the new name you'd like to give the file, using the below command. This will populate the application with starter data.

### `git mv starterdata.json database.json`


### `json-server -p 5002 -w database.json`
### `cd .. `
Verify that you are back in the project's root directory. Then in your terminal:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

# Until further notice, any changes made to database.json file while using this application are .gitignored and will not be pushed up to GitHub.

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
